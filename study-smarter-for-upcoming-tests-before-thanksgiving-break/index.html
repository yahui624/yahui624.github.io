      <p>November is coming and there are about two weeks to Thanksgiving Holiday! We are all looking forward to the Thanksgiving break while we still have midterms, projects coming up in the upcoming weeks. Here are some tips that I hope can help you manage study better and stay happy.</p>
<h2 id="study-tips">Study Tips:</h2>
<h3 id="pay-attention-to-the-due-dates-and-exam-dates">Pay attention to the due dates and exam dates.</h3>
<p>You can save important dates on your laptop or on a notebook. There are online apps like Google Keep, or Windows Sticky Notes that can remind you of the upcoming things. If there are several things coming up together, you need to plan ahead to avoid the rush or low performance on tasks. Survey shows 90% college students procrastinate so don’t let that be your excuse of not finishing what you need to do.</p>
<h3 id="visit-professors-during-office-hours">Visit professors during office hours</h3>
<p>Visiting professors during office hours can help you clarify your problems and you can always learn a lot. Be prepared about your questions and ask your professor politely. Don’t stop yourself from going because you are afraid of your questions being silly. Professors are there to help you and they are always happy to see you are working hard! Talking to your professor is a great way to explore your interests for the class and build the connection between you and your professor.</p>
<h2 id="happy-tips">Happy Tips</h2>
<h3 id="never-feel-bad-about-yourself">Never feel bad about yourself.</h3>
<p>Class material and projects can be challenging and frustrate you. But do not get overwhelmed about the situations. You are not the only one who feel like this. Remember you are not alone and your parents are always the greatest support for you. Call your parents and share your college life with them. CNN reported that college students talking on the phone with their parents reduce a key stress hormone and also releases oxytocin, a feel-good brain chemical that cheers people up. Remember those happy moments and believe you can do it!</p>
<h3 id="restrict-the-amount-of-caffeine">Restrict the amount of caffeine.</h3>
<p>A lot of people need caffeine in their daily life. Study shows that caffeine can boost alertness, cognitive performance, and short-term memory. We average consume about two cups of coffee (100-200 caffeine) a day and going about 400 mg daily can cause serious problem. Too much caffeine can raise tension and blood pressure and is getting in the way of a good night&rsquo;s sleep for college students and directly affects academic performance. There are ways you can do if you feel tired: taking a nap, going to the gym, drinking water instead of coffee, etc. Caffeine is not the only way to keep yourself functioning!</p>
